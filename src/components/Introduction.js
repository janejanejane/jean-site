            <p>Hi!, I'm Jean. I currently reside in New Zealand. I am fortunate to have been granted a Permanent Resident Visa here.</p>
            <p>I’ve worked in software development for around 10 years. My work experience has mainly been on front-end web development. But I have also done back-end development using Ruby on Rails, PHP, and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>I’m comfortable figuring out legacy application and adding features to it. Most of my entry tasks have been this way.</p>
            <p>I am currently on a career break now to focus on my kids’ wellbeing.</p>
            <p>You can look at my work experience below, before I took this hiatus.</p>
